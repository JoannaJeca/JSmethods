// Hey guys, just learnt new, awesome things on JavaScript class on variable declaration and datatypes/
// Just a quck summary, there are five primitive datatypes and when i say primitive, i mean where other
// datatypes are gotten from. they are;
// String (representing sequence of textual characters and it
// begins with a double quote. eg "hello world")
// Number (representng numeric values or floating points/integers eg 10, 20.10)
// Boolean (representing boolean value either true or false)
// undefined (representing an undefined value)
// null (representing null, i.e, no value at all)
// and now the non-primitive datatypes; Array; used to store multiple values in a single variable
// (container). they are enclosed in square brackets.
// object are used to represent a data in a key and a vakue.
// we will have great discussion on eeach data type later

// itd be bext understandable to do this practically.....follow my examples, wink watch me
// using the let keyword to declare these variables and have fun with datatypes.
